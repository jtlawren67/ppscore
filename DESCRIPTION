Description: The PPS is an asymmetric, data-type-agnostic score that can detect linear or non-linear relationships between two columns. The score ranges from 0 (no predictive power) to 1 (perfect predictive power). It can be used as an alternative to the correlation (matrix).  This package is a R port of the Python version developed by [8080Labs](https://github.com/8080labs/ppscore).
